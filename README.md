## Overview
- This build demonstrates the **Options Menu**, **Settings Persistence**, **Dynamic Materials**, **Accessibility Features**, and **Keybinding System**.
- It is **not a full game build**. It is focused specifically on the menu and UI systems I developed and tested.
- Created using **Unreal Engine 5**.

## Features
- Fully modular menu system
- Save and load of settings across sessions
- Custom dynamic materials for button styling
- Real-time input rebinding with Enhanced Input
- Accessibility options including contrast and color vision modes
- Controller, keyboard, and mouse compatibility
- Quit functionality from Main and Pause Menus

## Controls
- **M** — Open Main Menu
- **P** — Open Pause Menu
- **O** — Open Options Menu
- Navigate: Mouse, Keyboard, or Controller
- Confirm / Select: Left Mouse Button / Enter / Controller A button
- Escape / Back: Escape key / Controller B button
- **Quit Game** — Use the "Quit" button available on the Main Menu and Pause Menu

## Important Notes
- This executable was created to document and demonstrate the menu system before external changes were made during final project integration.
- Some visual inconsistencies may exist compared to the final team build.
- Settings changes (e.g., resolution, contrast) are saved between sessions using a hybrid SaveGame system.

## Video Walkthrough
A full video walkthrough of the original menu system is also available (link provided in the main project documentation).
